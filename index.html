    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
       One of the biggest beliefs that I have regarding teaching is that in order for the 
      student to succeed, the teacher must adapt to the student. That's the beauty of one
      on one lessons, you learn where the student thrives and where their faults are. As 
      a team, you work through how to make those faults their strong suits. When it comes 
      to my system of teaching, I really love a good balance of warmups, theory, and making 
      it fun so that it engages the student. Of course, depending on the student it may need
      some altering, but enagement is key
